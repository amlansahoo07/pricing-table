# Pricing Table Flexbox Project

This project is a responsive pricing table built using HTML and CSS Flexbox. It was developed as part of Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a responsive pricing table that adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox. The table features three pricing plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Each plan displays various features, and the layout adjusts dynamically based on the width of the viewport.

## Features

- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox
- Three pricing tiers: Basic, Standard, and Premium
- Dynamic adjustment of pricing cards based on available width
- Mobile-friendly design with vertical stacking of pricing cards on smaller screens
- Customized styles using Google Fonts

## Project Details

### HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure for the pricing table. The content includes three pricing cards with headings, features, and call-to-action buttons. The necessary text and basic structure are provided.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) includes the styles for the pricing table. Key styles include:

- Flexbox for layout management
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Background colors, borders, and corner radii
- Button styling

### Media Queries

Media queries are used to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. When the viewport width is below a certain threshold, the pricing cards stack vertically instead of being displayed horizontally.
